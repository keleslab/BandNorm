\title{Juicer hic version of BandNorm}
\usage{
bandnorm_juicer(path = NULL, resolution, pairs, save = TRUE, save_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path for all the cells in a directory. There can be sub-directories.}

\item{resolution}{Specify the resolution from the hic file.}

\item{pairs}{Specify the pairs of chromosomes to use, the format is like "1_1" or "chr1_chr1". If the input is "all_all", it will include all the intra-chromosomal bin pairs.}

\item{save}{Whether to save each normalized cells. Default is TRUE. Note that if don't have large memory on your computer, and you need to use create_embedding function, it is highly recommended to save the cells because it helps lower the cost of memory in this function.}

\item{save_path}{Indicate the output path for normalized cells. Only need it when "save" parameter is TRUE. Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate the BandNorm normalization using the inputs that are Juicer .hic format, and the output won't be different from the original version.
