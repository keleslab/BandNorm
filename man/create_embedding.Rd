\usage{
create_embedding(
  path = NULL,
  hic_df = NULL,
  mean_thres = 0,
  var_thres = 0,
  dim_pca = 50,
  do_harmony = FALSE,
  batch = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path for all the normalized cells in a directory. There can be sub-directories. Using path means loading the bandnorm normalized data iteratively from the directory, so it is relatively slower than using hic_df. However, it won't eat up your memory too much, and the speed is acceptable.}

\item{hic_df}{After using bandnorm, if you keep the data frame, it is possible to use this instead of "path" as input of create_embedding. If using hic_df, the speed will be faster, but is costs more memory.}

\item{mean_thres}{The proportion of low mean interactions to be filtered. Ranges from 0 to 1, default is 0.}

\item{var_thres}{The proportion of low variance interactions to be filtered. Ranges from 0 to 1, default is 0.}

\item{dim_pca}{Dimension of PCA embedding to be outputted. Default is 50.}

\item{do_harmony}{Whether to use Harmony to remove the batch effect from the embedding. Default is FALSE}

\item{batch}{The batch information used for Harmony to remove the batch effect. Required if do_harmony is TRUE.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to obtain the PCA embedding for tSNE or UMAP plotting.
